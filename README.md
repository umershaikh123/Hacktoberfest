## What is Hacktoberfest 🤖?
Hacktoberfest, in its 9th year, is a month-long celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean. During the month of October, we invite you to join open-source software enthusiasts, beginners, and the developer community by contributing to open-source projects. You can do this in a variety of ways:

- Prepare and share your project for collaboration
- Contribute to the betterment of a project via pull requests or merge requests 
 
 
## How Does it Work ❔

Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community!

#### Maintainers determine if their open-source projects participate by adding the ‘hacktoberfest’ topic.
#### Quality pull requests submitted on GitHub and GitLab are rewarded.
#### Engaged maintenance of Hacktoberfest tagged repositories are rewarded.
## Here's what you need to participate and complete Hacktoberfest:
 - Register anytime between September 26 and October 31
 - Pull requests can be made in any GITHUB or GITLAB hosted project that’s participating in Hacktoberfest (look for the “hacktoberfest” topic)
 - Project maintainers must accept your pull/merge requests for them to count toward your total
 - Have 4 pull/merge requests accepted between October 1 and October 31 to complete Hacktoberfest
 
## Pull/Merge Request Details 📄
 
 - Repos that go against hacktoberfest’s values will be excluded from qualification and pr/mrs made to those repos won’t count.
 - Your pr/mrs must not be spammy.
 - Your pr/mrs must be in a repo tagged with the “hacktoberfest” topic, or be labeled “hacktoberfest-accepted.” 
 - Your pr/mrs must be merged, have the “hacktoberfest-accepted” label, or have an overall approving review.
 - Your pr/mrs Must be useful in any field and not some copy paste code
